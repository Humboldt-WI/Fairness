Description: Offers various different metrics of algorithmic fairness. Fairness in machine learning is an emerging 
  topic with the overarching aim to critically assess algorithms (predictive and classification models) whether
  their results reinforce existing social biases. While unfair algorithms can propagate such biases and offer
  prediction or classification results with a disparate impact on various sensitive subgroups of populations (defined
  by sex, gender, ethnicity, income, socioeconomic status, physical or mental disabilities), fair algorithms possess
  the underlying foundation that these groups should be treated similarly / should have similar outcomes. The fairness
  R package offers the calculation and comparisons of commonly and less commonly used fairness metrics in population
  subgroups. The package also offers convenient visualizations to help understand fairness metrics.
