## Package overview

The fairness R package provides tools to easily calculate algorithmic fairness metrics for given predicted probabilities or predicted classes between different sensitive groups. It also provides opportunities to visualize and compare other prediction metrics between the subgroups. 

The package contains functions to compute the most commonly used metrics of algorithmic fairness such as:   

- Demographic parity
- Proportional parity
- Equalized odds
- Predictive rate parity

In addition, the following comparisons are also implemented:    

- False positive rate parity
- False negative rate parity
- Accuracy parity
- Negative predictive value parity
- Specificity parity
- ROC AUC comparison
- MCC comparison

Most fairness measures are computed based on the confusion matrix resulting from fitting a binary classification model.


## Installation

You can instal the latest stable package version from CRAN by running:

```r
install.packages('fairness')
library(fairness)
```

You may also install the development version from Github:

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('kozodoi/fairness')
library(fairness)
```

## Fairness pipeline

You will find a detailed tutorial in the fairness vignette. We recommend that you spend some time going through the vignette, as it contains a much more in-depth description of the fairness package compared to this brief readme. The more detailed tutorial is also available in [this blogpost](https://kozodoi.github.io/blog/r/fairness/packages/2020/05/01/fairness-tutorial.html).

```r
vignette('fairness')
```

## Brief tutorial

### Loading the COMPAS sample dataset

```r
data('compas')
```

The data already contains all variables necessary to run all parity metrics. In case you set up your own predictive model, you will need to concatenate predicted probabilities or predictions (0/1) to your original dataset or supply them as a vector to the corresponding metric function.

### Running a selected function

```r
equal_odds(data         = compas, 
           outcome      = 'Two_yr_Recidivism',
           group        = 'ethnicity',
           probs        = 'probability', 
           preds_levels = c('no', 'yes'), 
           cutoff       = 0.5, 
           base         = 'Caucasian')
```

### Taking a look at the output

Metrics for equalized odds:     

```
#>                Caucasian African_American     Asian Hispanic
#> Sensitivity    0.7782982        0.5845443 0.9130435 0.809375
#> Equalized odds 1.0000000        0.7510544 1.1731281 1.039929
#>                Native_American     Other
#> Sensitivity          0.6666667 0.8493151
#> Equalized odds       0.8565697 1.0912463
```
